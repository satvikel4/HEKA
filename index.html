        <p>
            Presenting Project Heka, the health innovation that aims to efficiently diagnose diabetes as well spread awareness. Split up into two components, Project Heka incorporates machine learning in order to detect diabetes with an accuracy of 98%. The machine learning platform determines the best possible algorithm, from Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVC, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The algorithm with the best accuracy is chosen to be incorporated and uses number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes Pedigree Function, and age in order to make an accurate prediction. After predicting a given input’s diagnosis, the result is then sent to firebase, from which the Heka website displays on the diagnosis page. All in all, not only does Project Heka spread awareness of a very common health condition, but it also eases the ability to diagnose a patient using technology.

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
            The rise of diabetes first began with the pancreas of a dog being removed. As days the dog developed diabetes because of the lack of a key organ, the pancreas. Scientists later realized how key the pancreas was for our survival. The pancreas is the only organ that regulates blood sugar, therefore a life without it may be very difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            Early Treatments
            
            a “nonirritating” milk-and-carb diet, for example, milk with rice and starchy, gummy foods “to thicken the blood and supply salts” or milk and barley water boiled with bread
            powders of fenugreek, lupin, and wormseed
            narcotics, such as opium
            foods that are “easy of digestion,” such as veal and mutton
            rancid animal food
            tobacco
            green vegetables
            a carb-free diet
            Fasting
        </p>
        <p>
            Scientists later discovered that the pancreas used a chemical called insulin to regulate blood sugar. As technology developed a scientist named Sir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer discovered a way to artificially create such a chemical. As a result, today we have a solution to diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Years later scientists identified many who were insulin resistant rather than insulin deficient. Scientists later classified this type of diabetes as type 2 diabetes. In modern-day society many diabetes patients need a constant source of insulin that is created from animals.
